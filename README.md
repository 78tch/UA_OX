|1|DYN 57|The dynamic “57” has been the industry standard in the US for recording loud guitar amps since the late ’60s. Our model is based on a vintage unit from the ’70s. With a natural bass roll off and accentuated upper midrange, this mic always cuts through any mix with practically no need for console EQ.|
|2|DYN 421|The dynamic “421” has been a favorite choice for guitar in Europe since the early ’60s.Our model is based on a vintage white unit from 1963. The “421” has thicker bottom end and smoother treble response than the dynamic “57” making it a great choice for smooth distorted tones.|
|3|RIB 160|The ribbon “160” was used by England-based recording engineers to capture loud guitar amps and drums on some of the greatest rock records of the late ’60s. Our model is based on a vintage silver unit from the ’60s. It has a smooth midrange and warm treble response.|
|4|RIB 121|The ribbon “121” is a modern classic for electric guitar. With its silky high end and extended bass frequency range, many engineers pair the “121” with the “57” to even out the sound. The “121” is also great on its own, but depending on the speaker, you may want to use LOW CUT on the mic channels.|
|5|CON 414|The condenser “414” is the perfect mic for capturing high end clarity and low end punch. This solid-state condenser mic can instantly deliver a modern-sounding “smile” EQ curve. Depending on the speaker, you may want to use LOW CUT on the mic channels. |
